## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Firebase project with Realtime Database enabled
- Firebase Authentication enabled

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd umbrella-borrowing-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

#### Create Firebase Project
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or use existing "umbrella-system-e0ae7"
3. Enable Realtime Database in "asia-southeast1" region
4. Enable Authentication with Email/Password provider

#### Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here  
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

#### Set Up Firebase Database Rules
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "umbrellas": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": true
    },
    "activities": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Create Admin User
In Firebase Authentication, manually create an admin user with email/password.

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## üìä Database Schema

### Umbrellas Collection
```javascript
umbrellas: {
  "1": {
    id: 1,
    status: "available" | "borrowed",
    currentLocation: "‡πÉ‡∏ï‡πâ‡πÇ‡∏î‡∏°" | "‡∏®‡∏π‡∏ô‡∏¢‡πå‡∏Å‡∏µ‡∏¨‡∏≤" | "‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏á‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£",
    borrower: {
      nickname: "John",
      phone: "0123456789", 
      timestamp: 1723457200
    } | null,
    history: [
      { 
        type: "borrow" | "return", 
        timestamp: 1723457200, 
        location: "‡πÉ‡∏ï‡πâ‡πÇ‡∏î‡∏°",
        nickname: "John" 
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Activities Collection
```javascript
activities: {
  "activity_id": {
    type: "borrow" | "return",
    umbrellaId: 1,
    nickname: "John",
    location: "‡πÉ‡∏ï‡πâ‡πÇ‡∏î‡∏°", 
    timestamp: 1723457200,
    note: "Optional admin note"
  }
}
```

## üîß Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run type checking
npm run type-check
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Firebase Hosting (Recommended)

1. **Install Firebase CLI**
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

2. **Login and Initialize**
```bash
firebase login
firebase init hosting
```

3. **Build and Deploy**
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

### Vercel Deployment

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. **Deploy**

vercel --prod
```

### Environment Variables for Production
Ensure these environment variables are set in your deployment platform:
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys are safe for client-side use as they're designed for web applications
- Firebase Authentication handles secure admin login
- Database rules should be configured for production use
- Phone numbers are stored but never displayed publicly
- Admin routes are protected by authentication

## üé® Design System

### Colors
- **Primary**: Blue (#2563eb) for main actions
- **Success**: Green (#16a34a) for available umbrellas
- **Warning**: Orange (#ea580c) for borrowed umbrellas
- **Error**: Red (#dc2626) for errors and alerts

### Typography
- **Font**: Inter for clean, readable text
- **Sizes**: Responsive typography with mobile-first approach

### Components
